have player 1 select first then player 2. there will be buttons with their names (not images as of now) that will have the names of
characters.
when the button is selected it makes whichever cat that is selected have the tag either 'currentCatP1' or 'currentCatP2'.
there should be a cat manager with a list of all of them (such as with the card manager) and when sampleGame is active,
then it will check through the list of cats and whichever ones have a tag of 'currentCatP1' or 'currentCatP2' will be
enabled.

!make sure that whichever cat is selected the variable IS NOT DESTROYED ON LOAD NEW SCENE
